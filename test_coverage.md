   - Recommendation: No action needed

2. **CLI Arguments** - 0% coverage
   - Risk: Version flag might break
   - Impact: Minimal
   - Recommendation: Basic smoke test

## Test Improvement Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Failing Tests
- 11 tests currently failing
- Mostly file path and import issues
- Should achieve 100% pass rate

### Priority 2: Add Integration Tests
- Full test-taking flow (E2E)
- Multi-platform file handling
- Session persistence edge cases

### Priority 3: Performance Benchmarks
- Response time measurements
- Memory usage profiling
- Large dataset handling

### Priority 4: UI Testing
- Terminal mock for UI tests
- Basic interaction verification
- Error message display testing

## Summary

The MBTI test application has **good test coverage** for core business logic:
- ‚úÖ Scoring algorithm is thoroughly tested
- ‚úÖ Input validation is comprehensive
- ‚úÖ Session management is well covered
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UI and presentation layers lack direct tests
- ‚ùå No end-to-end tests exist

**Overall Assessment:** The critical paths are well-tested, ensuring the application will correctly determine personality types and handle user input safely. The main gaps are in presentation layer testing, which is acceptable for a terminal application with manual QA.
